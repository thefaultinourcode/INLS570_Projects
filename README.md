#INLS 560: Fundamentals of Programming Information Applications#

Course Description: Intermediate programming concepts in information processing and data analysis. Students will learn object-oriented programming, data structures, data analysis methods, and information processing techniques in the context of information science topics.

This class had two major projects that I completed as part of the course: a Fairy Tale search engine and an analysis of a Last.FM dataset. 

##Fairy Tale Search Engine##

This project helped me learn about how to design data structures to store information as well as retrieve it. This search engine stores the content of fairy tales and allows users to search for a word within the stories, displaying the name of the fairy tale(s) containing that work and the line(s) of text that include the word (with line numbers). 

Use the keywords **or**, **and**, **morethan**, **near** for more advanced queries. Here are a few examples you can try!

```
Please enter your query: raven or prince
Please enter your query: raven and prince
Please enter your query: raven morethan prince
Please enter your query: raven morethan 5
Please enter your query: raven near calling
```

##Last.fm Data Analysis##

This project was intended to help me learn how to do data analysis with the python libraries pandas and numpy. My professor gave me 8 questions to answer with this code. Run it to learn more about music users were listening to on last.fm!
